            Coffee beans come from the coffee plant, a bush-like plant which can
            get very tall (coffee farmers will usually keep them trimmed to
            around 5ft to keep them manageable). On these coffee plants, bunches
            of cherries grow and it’s inside these that you’ll find two coffee
            beans.
